 What is Git rebase and how can it be used to resolve conflicts in a feature branch before merge?

According to me, you should start by saying git rebase is a command which will merge another branch into the branch where you are currently working, and move all of the local commits that are ahead of the rebased branch to the top of the history on that branch.
Now once you have defined Git rebase time for an example to show how it can be used to resolve conflicts in a feature branch before merge, if a feature branch was created from master, and since then the master branch has received new commits, Git rebase can be used to move the feature branch to the tip of master.
The command effectively will replay the changes made in the feature branch at the tip of master, allowing conflicts to be resolved in the process. When done with care, this will allow the feature branch to be merged into master with relative ease and sometimes as a simple fast-forward operation.

Q10. What are the Different modes does a container can be run?
Docker container can be run in two modes

Attached:  Where it will be run in the foreground of the system you are running, provides a terminal inside to container when -t option is used with it, where every log will be redirected to stdout screen.

Detached: This mode is usually run in production, where the container is detached as a background process and every output inside the container will be redirected log files inside /var/lib/docker/logs/<container-id>/<container-id.json> and which can be viewed by docker logs command.



 it forms the base for container resource monitoring tools like advisor
